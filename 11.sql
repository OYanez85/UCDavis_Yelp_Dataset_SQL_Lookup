'''Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that
city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3
stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:

i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
'''i. Type of Analysis:
For this analysis, I have chosen to perform sentiment analysis on Yelp business reviews to determine the overall sentiment (positive or negative) of customer reviews for various businesses. The goal is to understand the sentiment of customer feedback and identify patterns in review sentiment across different business categories.''''

ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
'''ii. Data Required and Rationale:
To conduct sentiment analysis, I will need the following data:

Business data: Including business ID, category, and location (city).
Review data: Including review text, review rating (stars), and business ID.
I chose this data because it allows me to analyze customer reviews for businesses in different categories and locations. By examining the text and star ratings of reviews, I can assess the sentiment and overall satisfaction expressed by customers. This analysis can be valuable for businesses to understand customer sentiment and make data-driven decisions for improvements.'''

iii. Output of your finished dataset:
iii. Output of Finished Dataset:
The finished dataset will include the following columns:

Business ID
Business Category
City
Review Text
Star Rating
Sentiment (Positive, Negative, or Neutral)
iv. SQL Code to Create the Final Dataset:
To create the final dataset, I will need to extract relevant data from the "business" and "review" tables and perform sentiment analysis on the review text. Below is a simplified SQL code outline for this task:'''

iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:
-- Selecting relevant columns from the business and review tables
SELECT b.id, c.category AS business_category, b.city, r.text AS Review_text, b.stars AS star_rating
FROM business AS b
INNER JOIN review AS r ON b.id = r.business_id
INNER JOIN category AS c ON b.id = c.business_id;

-- Adding a sentiment column based on sentiment analysis results
-- The sentiment analysis part will depend on the specific tools or libraries used for sentiment analysis, such as Python's Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries.

-- Storing the final dataset in a table or exporting to a CSV or other format.
-- This part depends on the database and tools you are using.

-- Example sentiment analysis using Python's NLTK library (not SQL):
-- Use Python to analyze the "review_text" column and add a "sentiment" column to the dataset.

-- Store or export the final dataset for further analysis.
The actual sentiment analysis part may involve using external tools or libraries, such as NLTK or other NLP libraries in a programming language like Python. This SQL code outlines the data retrieval and preparation steps in SQL, but the sentiment analysis itself typically requires using appropriate NLP tools and programming languages.

| 2skQeu3C36VCiB653MIfrw | Food                   | Phoenix    | My husband and I decided to come here for a Saturday date night.

The shrimp and grits were simply glorious. I may have preferred grilled or sautéed shrimp, rather than fried, but the other ingredients did a great job of balancing the richness of the fried shrimp and bacon. Marvelous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |

I had been particularly looking forward to the turkey, but they had run out (something we weren't told until after the food was delivered and I inquired about it). The hot links were our least favorite - just not our thing, I guess. The pulled pork was pretty good, but the ribs and brisket were definitely the stars, and our favorites by a mile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |             |

I had been particularly looking forward to the turkey, but they had run out (something we weren't told until after the food was delivered and I inquired about it). The hot links were our least favorite - just not our thing, I guess. The pulled pork was pretty good, but the ribs and brisket were definitely the stars, and our favorites by a mile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |             |

That's about as much as I would pay for that dessert - $0 - as it tasted like hot, vaguely-fruity mush with a layer of raw flour on top.

| 2skQeu3C36VCiB653MIfrw | Barbeque               | Phoenix    | My husband and I decided to come here for a Saturday date night.

The shrimp and grits were simply glorious. I may have preferred grilled or sautéed shrimp, rather than fried, but the other ingredients did a great job of balancing the richness of the fried shrimp and bacon.

I had been particularly looking forward to the turkey, but they had run out (something we weren't told until after the food was delivered and I inquired about it). The hot links were our least favorite - just not our thing, I guess. The pulled pork was pretty good, but the ribs and brisket were definitely the stars, and our favorites by a mile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |             |

Everyone was very nice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |             |

| 20ib4z2Yo2wlfARFMcFwSQ | Desserts               | Pittsburgh | On a recent visit to Pgh I was happily surprised to find that numerous cupcake shops have sprung up since my last visit. Being the cupcake fanatic that I am, I tried Dozen, Coco's and Vanilla Pastry Studio. Although I think all three cupcake shops could have come up with better names, the VPS had the best products hands down. Over my 2 month visit, I tried their vanilla/vanilla, vanilla caramel, carrot, mocha and choc peanut butter. They were all incredible with the vanilla caramel being my favorite. And the atmosphere inside the shop is adorable, it made me want to skip around like I won the Willy Wonka golden ticket, and after tasting one of their cupcakes, into another world I went. |         4.5 |
